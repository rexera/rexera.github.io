### Intro: "ACL is not an AI conference"

**“ACL is not an AI conference.”** At ACL 2024, held in Bangkok, Thailand, this year’s ACL Chair, Emily M. Bender, put forth a highly controversial conclusion in [her address](https://bit.ly/EMB-ACL24).

She emphasized that ACL, as the Annual Meeting of the Association for *Computational Linguistics*, is not primarily focused on artificial intelligence, but rather on language technology and computational linguistics. While she acknowledged that machine learning (including deep learning) has provided many useful tools for these two, she argued that problems arise when the focus shifts towards AI.

Bender believes that ACL’s focus should be on “language,” grounded in an understanding of data, including knowledge of how language works (i.e., linguistics) and dataset documentation. On the other hand, AI focuses on “how to endow machines with human-like intelligence.”

Given the booming development of AI, its commercialization, and negative trends in the research community—such as the improper use of benchmarks, requirements to compare with closed SOTA models, and the excessive size of datasets leading to a lack of retained data—Bender remarked that if your research question revolves around “how to prove that my machine is intelligent,” such a focus could distort research practices. The upsurging emphasis on AI has also led to poor review practices, where papers that do not employ LLMs or fail to deliver LLM results at the SOTA scale may be deemed uninteresting.

Bender asserted that ACL should be a space focused on language technology, fostering interdisciplinary research, a field that cares about linguistic communities, and a place where we can rationally discuss the societal impacts of our research and technology.

This view sparked significant controversy. Some argued that the two fields have organically merged and cannot be separated; others felt this stance reflected narrow-mindedness; still, some expressed understanding, agreeing that AI does not necessarily emphasize a focus on language itself.
