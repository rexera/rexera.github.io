### Intro: "ACL is not an AI conference"

**“ACL is not an AI conference.”** At ACL 2024, held in Bangkok, Thailand, this year’s ACL Chair, Emily M. Bender, put forth a highly controversial conclusion in [her address](https://bit.ly/EMB-ACL24).

She emphasized that ACL, as the Annual Meeting of the Association for *Computational Linguistics*, is not primarily focused on artificial intelligence, but rather on language technology and computational linguistics. While she acknowledged that machine learning (including deep learning) has provided many useful tools for these two, she argued that problems arise when the focus shifts towards AI.

Bender believes that ACL’s focus should be on “language,” grounded in an understanding of data, including knowledge of how language works (i.e., linguistics) and dataset documentation. On the other hand, AI focuses on “how to endow machines with human-like intelligence.”

Given the booming development of AI, its commercialization, and negative trends in the research community—such as the improper use of benchmarks, requirements to compare with closed SOTA models, and the excessive size of datasets leading to a lack of retained data—Bender remarked that if your research question revolves around “how to prove that my machine is intelligent,” such a focus could distort research practices. The upsurging emphasis on AI has also led to poor review practices, where papers that do not employ LLMs or fail to deliver LLM results at the SOTA scale may be deemed uninteresting.

Bender asserted that ACL should be a space focused on language technology, fostering interdisciplinary research, a field that cares about linguistic communities, and a place where we can rationally discuss the societal impacts of our research and technology.

This view sparked significant controversy. Some argued that the two fields have organically merged and cannot be separated; others felt this stance reflected narrow-mindedness; still, some expressed understanding, agreeing that AI does not necessarily emphasize a focus on language itself.

### Something Personal

Where exactly are the boundaries of disciplines?

Being an art student through my entire high school, receiving only humanities training for four years consecutively, and attending a science and technology university to study linguistics, I have endured the low status of my major — this is the first one.

After ChatGPT going viral, the gap between the humanities and sciences has unprecedentedly widened, and humanities jobs have been replaced by a colossal margin — this is the second.

Amid the devastating impact of this second point, a new term, "digital humanities," emerged from a small number of successful initiatives led by non-humanities scholars. Out of nowhere, China’s most prestigious universities have launched relevant journals, organized conferences, and even established “social science laboratories.” But what exactly is digital humanities? As a linguistics student at a science university, this question has indeed perplexed me for a long time.

Is it the deciphering of oracle bone inscriptions that can be published in *Nature*? Or the digitization and intelligent annotation of ancient texts? Or is it simply discourse analysis supported by corpus data and fancy visualizations? We saw suddenly, a wave of computer scientists entered, but the ensuing work was all taken up by traditional humanities scholars, struggling to survive under the tsunami of the information age. What exactly is digital humanities? No one knows. This is the third.

Also after overcoming the devastating blow of the second point, I started learning mathematics, statistics, programming, and machine learning from scratch. Gradually, I became involved in research related to LLMs, and I realized how interesting and meaningful it is to apply LLMs to so many tasks, some of which definitely have something to do with linguistics — this is the fourth.

When I first entered this field and was preparing to choose my graduate direction, I became confused: What is the difference between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (hereinafter referred to as CL)? In terms of content, or even the names of top NLP conferences, these two fields seem to be identical. However, whether in previous boom of deep learning models or in the current AI wave, it seems to be purely a celebration of "NLP," while linguistics and computational linguistics have faded into obscurity.

However, after a whole fruitful year of reading more papers and gaining exposure to new advancements in both NLP technology and linguistic theory, I’ve reached a conclusion:

The previously dominant approach — represented by deep learning, big data, weak rules, empiricism, and connectionism — **will no longer hold its supremacy**. With the paradigm shift brought by LLMs, methods based on **small data, strong rules, rationalism, and symbolic systems** will experience a revival. 

The disappearance of the term "computational linguistics" was a manifestation of empiricism’s dominance, but with the resurgence of rationalism, the boundaries between NLP and CL will blur, leading to a gradual elevation of the status of both linguistics and CL.
