## Lost in Translation? When Puns Travel Between Languages  

We‚Äôve all been there: a pun so clever it makes you groan and grin at the same time. But what happens when you try to translate that pun between two very different languages‚Äîlike Chinese and English?  

Turns out, it‚Äôs harder than it looks. Most machine translation systems still struggle with humor, wordplay, and cultural nuance. That‚Äôs why we built **Pun2Pun**‚Äîa new benchmark designed specifically to test how well AI models can handle pun translation between Chinese and English, both in text and images.  

In our paper, we introduce a clever strategy called the **Constant-Variable Optimization (CVO) Model** and a new metric named **Overlap (Ovl)** to measure translation quality. We tested several state-of-the-art LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek, and others), and found that even the best models still have a long way to go when it comes to preserving humor across languages.

*Abstract:*  
> Puns, as a unique form of linguistic creativity, present significant challenges in cross-lingual translation, particularly between linguistically distant languages like Chinese and English, where it‚Äôs often considered a ‚Äúmission impossible‚Äù. We introduce Pun2Pun, a novel benchmark for quantitatively evaluating pun translation between Chinese and English while preserving both linguistic mechanisms and humorous effects. We propose the adaptation of Constant-Variable Optimization (CVO) Model for translation strategy and concomitant Overlap (Ovl) metric for translation quality assessment. Our approach provides a robust quantitative evaluation framework to assess models‚Äô complex linguistic and cultural reasoning capabilities in pun translation. Through extensive experiments on both textual and visual puns, we demonstrate that our translation strategy model significantly improves performance, particularly for better-performing models. Our findings reveal exciting potentials and current limitations of LLMs in preserving sophisticated humor across linguistic and cultural boundaries.
