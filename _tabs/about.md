My name is **MA Yiran (马义然)**, and I go by **Yiran Rex Ma** in papers (well, in the near future). Call me Yiran or Rex per your liking!

I am currently an undergraduate in School of Humanities, BUPT (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), majoring in English, Linguistics and Language Technologies (Class of 2026) with a minor in Data Science and Big Data Technologies. 

As for academic experiences, I graduated with distinction in a BAC-accredited summer program in University of Cambridge on "AI+ Large Language Models & Generative AI" instructed by [Pietro Liò](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/pl219) in August, 2024.

At precent, I am a research intern in Legal AI Group, [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn), supervised by [Yuxiao Ye](https://yeyuxiao.github.io). My work is mainly on multi-agent court scenario simulation, infusion of linguistics and sociology, and evaluating LLMs' proficiency on legalese.

My research concentration is around **Large Language Models** (LLMs), (Computational) **Linguistics**, and their intersections: 

- LLMs in **Multilinguality, Contrastive Syntax and Pragmatics**, and Language Diversity
- LLM-based **Multi-Agent Systems** (MAS) and Simulations
- **Non-Parametric Training** & **Reference-Free Evaluation** for LLMs
- LLM **Benchmarking in Language and Linguistics**
- ...

I am committed to furthering my knowledge in these areas and aspire to engage in interdisciplinary research, breaking down barriers of subjects.

...and I’m a language aficionado! American English and Mandarin Chinese are my primary working languages. Born and raised with Sichuan Dialect as my mother tone and Mandarin Chinese my first language, I’ve been learning English since 12, with fluency and academic proficiency. Besides, I’m currently on track for Spanish and French!

This is an academic profile/blog, where I update my academic news and whimsical thoughts. Enjoy!
