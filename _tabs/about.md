My name is **MA Yiran (马义然)**, and I go by **Yiran Rex Ma** in papers. Call me *Yiran* or *Rex* per your liking :)

I'm with [Peking University & ByteDance Digital Humanities Open Laboratory (PKUDH)](https://pkudh.org) and serving as a visiting associate of [Qwen Team](https://qwenlm.github.io/) in Alibaba Group, working on **Multi-Modal Intelligence** on cultural heritage. 

Coming in September 2026, I'm going to be admitted to Peking Univeristy as a PhD in _Theoretical and Applied Linguistics_, supervised by [Prof. SU Qi](https://pkudh.org/member/suqi.html). My concentration is/will be on computational linguistics, specifically on human-machine, English-Chinese, and mechanical neural substrates.

Currently, I'm a senior BA in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), majoring in _English, Linguistics and Language Technologies_ with a minor in _Data Science and Big Data Technologies_. From September 2024 to August 2025, I was a research intern in AI+X subdivisions in [TsinghuaNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn) with [Prof. LIU Zhiyuan](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). Before that, I was primarily trained in the humanities with a discovered and ever since ongoing passion for human languages.

## Current Scope

My current foucs is on: **AI Data Governance**: 

> Aside from being increasingly proficient "sense-making machines" on formal levels, AIs fall short of what cannot be modeled intuitively at present, namely, agency/subjectivity, knowledge, experience, emotion, culture, ... Moreover, pain, gap, imperfection, ... Therefore, I aspire to engage in attempts at:

- Self-supervised data/context curation
- Synthesization and augmentation
- _Omni_ representation and alignment
- ...

> "If you don't live in the future today, you will live in the past tomorrow". I will keep making my contribution through consistent, bit-by-bit action. Even baby steps matter.

## Closing Remarks

...and I’m a language aficionado! American English and Simplified Chinese are my primary working languages, while I was born and raised with Sichuan Dialect as my mother tone and Mandarin Chinese my first language. Besides, I’m currently on track for Spanish, French, and Traditional Chinese (and more...). Hopefully I will become a polyglot :)

This is an academic/personal profile/blog, where I update news and whimsical thoughts. Enjoy!
