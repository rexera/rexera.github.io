My name is **MA Yiran (马义然)**, and I go by **Yiran Rex Ma** in papers. Call me *Yiran* or *Rex* per your liking!

I am with [PKU-ByteDance Digital Humanities Open Laboratory (PKUDH)](https://pkudh.org) in Peking University, working on **Multi-Modality Intelligence** on cultural heritage. I am currently a senior in School of Humanities, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), majoring in English, Linguistics and Language Technologies with a minor in Data Science and Big Data Technologies. 

Coming in September 2026, I am to be admitted to Peking Univeristy as a master majored in Foreign Linguistics and Applied Linguistics in School of Foreign Languages with a concentration on computational linguistics, supervised by [Prof. SU Qi](https://pkudh.org/member/suqi.html).

From September 2024 to August 2025, I was a research intern in Legal AI Subdivision in [TsinghuaNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn), supervised by [Dr. YE Yuxiao](https://yeyuxiao.github.io). My work revolved around multi-agent court simulation system, integration of linguistics, and evaluating LLMs' proficiency on legalese.

My current research scope is: **Data-Front AI**: 

Aside from being increasingly proficient "sense-making machines" on formal levels, AIs fall short of what cannot be modeled intuitively at present, namely:

**Human agency/subjectivity, knowledge, experience, emotion, culture, ...** Moreover, **pain, gap, imperfection, ...**

Therefore, I aspire to engage in attempts at **self-supervised data curation**, **synthesization and augmentation**, and **super representation and alignment**, serving *full modality, large scale continous training and reinforcement learning*.

While this may sound far-fetched, "if you don't live in the future today, you will live in the past tomorrow". I will keep making my contribution through consistent, bit-by-bit action. Even baby steps matter!

...and I’m a language aficionado! American English and Simplified Chinese are my primary working languages, while I was born and raised with Sichuan Dialect as my mother tone and Mandarin Chinese my first language. Besides, I’m currently on track for Traditional Chinese, Spanish and French! Hopefully I will become a polyglot :)

This is an academic profile/blog, where I update my academic news and whimsical thoughts. Enjoy!
