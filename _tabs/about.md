I am currently an undergraduate in School of Humanities, BUPT (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), majoring in English, Linguistics and Language Technologies (Class of 2026) with a minor in Data Science and Big Data Technologies. 

As for academic experiences, I graduated with distinction in a BAC-accredited summer program in University of Cambridge on "AI+ Large Language Models & Generative AI" instructed by [Pietro Liò](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/pl219) in August, 2024.

At precent, I am a research intern in Legal AI Group, [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn), supervised by [Yuxiao Ye](https://yeyuxiao.github.io). My work is mainly on multi-agent court scenario simulation, infusion of linguistics and sociology, and evaluating LLMs' proficiency on legalese.

My current research concentration is **Linguistic Issues around Computation**: 

- Linguistic Knowledge Representation and Architecture Fusion (Multi-Agent, Non-Parametric Methods, etc.)
- Paleography and Multilinguality
- Language Ability Augmentation and Benchmarking
- ...

I am committed to furthering my knowledge in these areas and aspire to engage in interdisciplinary research, boosting in-depth fusion of language and computation.

...and I’m a language aficionado! American English and Simplified Chinese are my primary working languages, while I was born and raised with Sichuan Dialect as my mother tone and Mandarin Chinese my first language. Besides, I’m currently on track for Traditional Chinese, Spanish and French!

This is an academic profile/blog, where I update my academic news and whimsical thoughts. Enjoy!
