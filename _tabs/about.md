I am currently a senior in School of Humanities, BUPT (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), majoring in English, Linguistics and Language Technologies (Class of 2026) with a minor in Data Science and Big Data Technologies. 

Coming in September, 2026, I am going to be admitted to Peking Univeristy to continue my academic journey as a Master student in School of Foreign Languages majored in Foreign Linguistics and Applied Linguistics, with a concentration on computational linguistics.

From September, 2024 to August, 2025, I was a research intern in Legal AI Subdivision in [TsinghuaNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn), supervised by [Dr. Yuxiao Ye](https://yeyuxiao.github.io). My work revolved around multi-agent court scenario simulation, infusion of linguistics, and evaluating LLMs' proficiency on legalese.

My current research scope is: **Linguistic Issues around Computation**: 

- Linguistic Knowledge Representation/Mechanism and Architecture Fusion
- Intersection of Language, Mind-Brain/Cognition, and Computation
- AI-Enhanced Linguistic Knowledge Discovery; Contrastive Linguistics & Multilinguality
- Language Ability Augmentation and Benchmarking
- ...

I am committed to furthering my knowledge in these areas and aspire to engage in interdisciplinary research, boosting in-depth fusion of language and computation.

...and I’m a language aficionado! American English and Simplified Chinese are my primary working languages, while I was born and raised with Sichuan Dialect as my mother tone and Mandarin Chinese my first language. Besides, I’m currently on track for Traditional Chinese, Spanish and French! Hopefully I will become a polyglot!

This is an academic profile/blog, where I update my academic news and whimsical thoughts. Enjoy!
