> 你好！Hello! Bonjour ! Hola!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/707dbf60-a038-469b-8a4e-deb24f11355a)



My name is **MA Yiran (马义然)**, and I go by **Yiran Rex Ma** in papers (well, in the near future). Call me Yiran or Rex per your liking!

I am an undergraduate majoring in English, Linguistics and Language Technologies (Class of 2026) with a minor in Data Science and Big Data Technologies. 

My research is around **Large Language Models** (LLMs), (Computational) **Linguistics**, and their intersections: 

- LLMs in **Computational Linguistics**
- LLM-based **Multi-Agent Systems** (MAS)
- **Non-Parametric Training** for LLMs
- LLM **Benchmarking in Language and Linguistics**
- ...

I am committed to furthering my knowledge in these areas and aspire to engage in interdisciplinary research, breaking down academic barrier.

And I’m a language aficionado! American English and Mandarin Chinese are my primary working languages. Born and raised with Sichuan Dialect as my mother tone and Mandarin Chinese my first language, I’ve been learning English since 12, with fluency and academic proficiency. Besides, I’m currently on track for Spanish and French!

This is an Academic Profile/Blog, where I update my academic news and thoughts. Enjoy!
