My name is **MA Yiran (马义然)**, and I go by **Yiran Rex Ma** in papers. Call me *Yiran* or *Rex* per your liking :)

I'm with [Peking University & ByteDance Digital Humanities Open Laboratory (PKUDH)](https://pkudh.org) and serving as a visiting associate of [Qwen Team](https://qwenlm.github.io/) in Alibaba Group, working on **Multi-Modal Intelligence** on cultural heritage. 

Coming in September 2026, I'm going to be admitted to Peking Univeristy as a PhD in _Theoretical and Applied Linguistics_, supervised by [Prof. SU Qi](https://pkudh.org/member/suqi.html). My concentration is on computational linguistics, specifically on neural substrates, in latent space of artificial neural networks.

Currently, I'm a senior BA in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), majoring in _English, Linguistics and Language Technologies_ with a minor in _Data Science and Big Data Technologies_. From September 2024 to August 2025, I was a research intern in _AI for Humanities/Social Sciences_ subdivisions in [TsinghuaNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn) with [Prof. LIU Zhiyuan](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). Before that, I was primarily trained in the humanities with a discovered and ever since ongoing passion for human languages.

## Current Scope

My current foucs is on: **Agentic Agency**, including but not limited to: 

- **Data**: Unsupervised, low-resource, heuristic methods to align human knowledge, experience, and emotion.
- **Algo**: Multi-scale memory, lifelong learning solutions within intelligence core.
- **Architecture**: Modularized, dynamic, autonomously adaptive and deploying; enhance "intuition/_sense_" to elevate efficiency (complementing training/inference infra).

> Agentic Agency (AA) franchise is cooking up. Stay tuned 😆

## Last but not least

I’m a something of a language aficionado. American English and Simplified Chinese are my primary working languages, while I was born and raised with Sichuan Dialect as my mother tone and Mandarin Chinese my first language. Besides, I’m currently on track for Spanish, French, and Traditional Chinese (and more...). And if we think of language (both natural and programming) as a _human-driven probability system_, I also hope to establish proficiency bestriding among major languages, to become a (self-proclaimed) full-stack polyglot 🥰

This is an academic/personal profile/blog, where I update news and whimsical thoughts. Enjoy!
