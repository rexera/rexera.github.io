I am with [PKU-ByteDance Digital Humanities Open Laboratory (PKUDH)](https://pkudh.org) in Peking University, working on **Multi-Modal Intelligence** on cultural heritage. 

Currently, I am a senior in School of Humanities, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), majoring in _English, Linguistics and Language Technologies_ with a minor in _Data Science and Big Data Technologies_. Before that, I was primarily trained in the humanities with a discovered and ever since ongoing passion for human languages.

Coming in September 2026, I am to be admitted to Peking Univeristy as a master majoring in _Foreign Linguistics and Applied Linguistics_ in School of Foreign Languages with a concentration on computational linguistics, specifically human-machine _information structure asymmetry_ between English and Chinese, supervised by [Prof. SU Qi](https://pkudh.org/member/suqi.html).

From September 2024 to August 2025, I was a research intern in both _Legal AI_ and _Computational Paleography_ subdivisions in [TsinghuaNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn), working around multi-agent court simulation, evaluating legalese generation, and graph-based Oracle Bone Inscription processing.

My current scope is: **AI Data Governance**: 

Aside from being increasingly proficient "sense-making machines" on formal levels, AIs fall short of what cannot be modeled intuitively at present, namely, agency/subjectivity, knowledge, experience, emotion, culture, ... Moreover, pain, gap, imperfection, ... Therefore, I aspire to engage in attempts at:

- Self-supervised data curation
- Synthesization and augmentation
- _"Super"_ representation and alignment
- ...

All serving full modality, large scale continous training and reinforcement learning.

> While this may sound far-fetched, "if you don't live in the future today, you will live in the past tomorrow". I will keep making my contribution through consistent, bit-by-bit action. Even baby steps matter!

...and I’m a language aficionado! American English and Simplified Chinese are my primary working languages, while I was born and raised with Sichuan Dialect as my mother tone and Mandarin Chinese my first language. Besides, I’m currently on track for Spanish, French, and Traditional Chinese. Hopefully I will become a polyglot :)

This is an academic/personal profile/blog, where I update news and whimsical thoughts. Enjoy!
